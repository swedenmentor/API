In order to receive a full basic deduction, you have to live in Sweden throughout the income year.How large a basic deduction you receive depends on how large your income is.See the tables in the links.Basic deductions If you have not lived in Sweden all year if you have not lived in Sweden throughout the income year, you are sometimes entitled to basic deductions for the whole year.Then you must request the basic deduction yourself in your income tax return, under other information.If you partly lived in another country but declare 90 percent or more of your income (salary, fees or similar) for the current income year in Sweden, you can receive basic deductions for the entire year.If you partly lived in another country but have not declared 90 percent or more of your income in Sweden, you will receive a reduced basic deduction.The reduced basic deduction is one -twelfth of 0.293 price base amounts for each month that you have lived in Sweden.The basic deduction is rounded up to almost SEK 100.A death estate receives no basic deduction for years after the death year.No basic deduction on income from passive business if you only have income from passive business activities you will not receive a basic deduction.This is because the basic deduction must not be higher than the total surplus of service and active business activities has decreased by general deductions.Higher basic deductions for persons over 66 years according to current rules, you who have reached the age of 66 at the beginning of the income year and have been resident in Sweden throughout the income year an increased basic deduction.The increased basic deduction is included in the Swedish Tax Agency's tax tables.The age limits in the pension system have been increased from 1 January 2023.

The surplus is SEK 10,000.When in year 5 he declares his operations on Appendix T2, in addition to filling in information on income, expenses and surplus, he can also deduct his saved deficit from year 1. The business surplus is SEK 10,000 so Adam can deduct SEK 10,000Of the deficit of SEK 20,000 he declared in year 1. After the deduction, his surplus will be included in the declaration SEK 0.In year 6, the business gets a deficit.Adam cannot then use the SEK 10,000 that remains from the deficit in year 1. Since it has been five years, he can no longer save the deficit but it falls away.In the year 7, the business also gets a deficit and Adam cannot use the deficit he declared in year 2. If the business would give a surplus during year 8, Adam can deduct its saved deficit from year 3 at SEK 10,000.In the case of surplus, you must pay self -fees If your hobby business provides surplus, you must pay deductions on the surplus.Self -contributions are the social security contributions you have to pay when you have your own business.For employees, the employer instead pays employer contributions.If you were born between 1938 - 1956, deductibles are 10.21 % of the surplus.

The amounts are usually pre -filled in your declaration.This also applies if you switch from one fund to another (selling one fund and buying another).The information on this page refers to shares in securities funds and special funds.Information on taxation of shares in other funds can be found in legal guidance.Standard income and dividends You who own fund shares should take up a standard income as income from capital, whether you have sold fund shares or not during the year.The standard income is calculated by your bank or fund company and is pre -filled in your declaration.The standard income is 0.4 % of the value of the fund shares at the beginning of the year.The actual tax becomes 0.12 % (0.4 * 30 %) of the value.The standard income to be included in the income tax return in 2023 is calculated on the value of the fund shares on January 1, 2022. If you have received a dividend from your fund, it must also be taxed as income from capital.Control data The fund companies that manage the funds, or your bank, submit a check information on accounting in your declaration if your bank or fund company has provided control information on dividends, standard income and profit or loss on sale, the information is pre -filled in your income declaration.Then you do not normally need to fill in any additional information in your income tax return.In the following two cases, you must make your own calculation of profit or loss if a fund has been put together with another fund or if the fund has been shared, you should not usually report it in your declaration.You will receive information about this from your bank or from the fund manager.How to calculate profit or loss yourself if you are to calculate profit or loss from sales, you should address what you got paid for the fund shares, that is, the sales price, as stated in the settlement note.From the sale price you can then deduct what you have paid for the shares, ie the cost amount.The cost amount also includes such dividends that are automatically reinvested in new shares.Deposit or withdrawal fees are normally included in the profit calculation that you have received in the control task, but if you do the calculation yourself, you should take them into account.You must not deduct the management expenses that the fund company reports to you as a unit owner, neither in the profit calculation nor as a management expense.Please note that your bank or fund company has generally taken into account which of the calculation methods below are most advantageous for you already in the control task.When calculating the cost amount, use the average method.The cost amount for a fund share is normally the price you have actually paid for it.The average method means that you calculate the average cost amount for all shares in the same fund, regardless of how and when they have been acquired (however, each trustee is calculated individually).Assume the acquisition expenses at each occasion and divide by the number of shares.The average value changes after each acquisition.If you have sold market -listed fund shares, you may calculate the cost amount to 20 percent of the sales price (the standard method).If you have purchased fund shares before 1995, you can use the market value on 31 December 1992 (the so -called knitting value) as a cost amount.Please note that the rule does not apply to public funds.For shares in public funds acquired before January 1, 1991, the value on December 31, 1990 may be included as the cost amount for that proportion.If the actual acquisition cost is higher, it may be deducted instead.Therefore, in an average calculation, both actual acquisition cost and the value at the end of 1990 or 1992 can be included for different shares.If you have received fund shares in inheritance, gift or in the case of housing division, take over the previous owner's cost amount.You", "updated": "2023-11-07"}

You believe the stock market will fall and that the index in a month will be below 1460. You therefore buy a number under(\"OMXS30 under 1460\") with end day in a month.You buy 4,000 pieces at a price of SEK 0.25 per piece, ie a total investment of SEK 1,000 (SEK 4,000 × 0.25), before commission/trade fees.If the OMXS30 index on the end day ends in 1460, yours will receive a value of SEK 1 per below, ie a total of SEK 4,000.The profit will then be SEK 4000 - 1000 = SEK 3,000 (value on end day - investment amount = profit).If, on the other hand, the index does not end under 1460, your entire invested amount is lost and you make a loss of SEK 1,000.To issue binary options in similar ways as for regular options, you can also exhibit or sell binary options.Anyone who issues an over believes that the share will not end above the value point.If the share on the end day does not end above the value point, the person who issued the option will be allowed to retain the amount given by the sale (issuance), which will then be the profit from the investment.However, the share will end above the value point, the issuer will also in this case retain the amount given by the sale (issuance), but are forced to pay SEK 1 per issued option to the buyer.The person who issues a miracle believes that the stock", "updated": "2023-11-07"}

A forward contract is considered completed on the liquid day, so the control assignment is submitted to the year the liquid day.This means, for example, that if a forward contract ends on December 29, 2022 and the day day falls on January 2, 2023, a checking assignment will be submitted for the year 2023.
